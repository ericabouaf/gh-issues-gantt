![Gantt Diagram](screenshot.png?raw=true "GitHub Issues Gantt")


## Installation

Requires Node.js

* Clone the git repository, and install dependencies

````sh
$ git clone git://github.com/neyric/gh-issues-gantt.git
$ cd gh-issues-gantt
$ npm install
````

## Configuration

* copy config.example.js to config.js, and set the repo GitHub credentials

* copy public/config.example.js to config.js, and edit the options

## Custom colors per developer

In public/stylesheets/style.css
Add the lines:


````css
.fn-gantt .ganttUser1 { background-color: #DCBFEE; } // The color of the issue
.fn-gantt .ganttUser1 .fn-label { color: #4F1D6B; } // The color of the issue text
````

to the end somewhere.
Change 'User1' to anything so long as it is the same for both. You can also add as many users as you want.
Change the '#DCBFEE' to any HTML color. 
Change the '#4F1D6B' to a darker version of the first color. (Or have light text, and dark issues....)

Next, in public/config.js
Find the line:
````js
"unassigned": "ganttRed"
````
and before it, add the line:

````js
    "MySuperAwesomeGitHubUsername": "ganttUser1",
````

Take note: 
Username is case sensitive.
Use the same style as you added to the .css file.
Remember to add a comma at the end of the line. (Page will not load charts if there is a syntax error)
